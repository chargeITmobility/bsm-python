# Bauer BSM-WS36A-H01-1311-0000 Python Interface and Modbus Tool

## Overview

This package contains a Python 3 library and a command line tool for
interacting with a BSM-WS36A-H01-1311-0000. Both allow you to explore the
communication and common tasks like:

* Reading data from registers
* Setting parameters
* Creating snapshots
* Verifying a snapshot signature

So this package might come in handy for testing communication and integrating
the meter in your environment.

The command line tool gets installed as `bsmtool`.

* [pySunSpec](https://github.com/sunspec/pysunspec/)
    * As there is currently no package available at pypi.org, we integrated it
