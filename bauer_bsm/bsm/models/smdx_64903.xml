      <label>BSM Signed OCMF Data</label>
      <description>
        An OCMF representation of a BSM Signed Snapshot (model ID 64901).
        Signed snapshots and their OCMF representations are matched by the
        'Typ' data point.

        The OCMF representation contains selected data from the underlying
        snapshot. For example, 'Meta1' is taken as identity information and the
        other metadata data points are omitted.
      </description>
      <notes>
        Use the underlying snapshot's 'St' data point for creating snapshot
        data.  Once the snapshot is valid, you could read its OCMF
        representation from here.

        <notes>
          Creating this snapshot executes the turn-on sequence for an external

          Creating this snapshot executes the turn-on sequence for an external

        <notes>
          Write this value to the underlying snapshot's data point 'St' to
          trigger the creation of a new snapshot. Afterwards poll this data
          point until its value changes to a different symbol indicating the
          outcome of the update process.

        <description>
          Creating the snapshot failed due to an issue with rendering OCMF data

          data is invalid.
